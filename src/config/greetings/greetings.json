    "Mornin’, traveler! Did ya know the sun’s just a spotlight circlin’ above our heads?",
    "Mind yer step! The edge of the world is closer than you think, keep your boots tight!",
    "You lookin’ to trade, or just tryin’ to find where the oceans fall off the side?",
    "Ain’t much ‘round here but mud and flat horizons… but I swear the map don’t lie!",
    "Heh! You city folk don’t know the joy of seein’ a straight horizon stretch forever!",
    "Morning! Keep an eye out, the stars spin above us in a big flat dome!",
    "Careful with them horses! They might wander too close to the world’s edge, ha!",
    "I’ve farmed this land for years, and I tell ya, the world ain’t no globe, it’s flat as a pancake!",
    "You ever notice how the rivers run straight to nowhere? That’s flat earth magic, friend!",
    "Step lightly, traveler — the horizon’s flat, but our imagination stretches beyond it!"
